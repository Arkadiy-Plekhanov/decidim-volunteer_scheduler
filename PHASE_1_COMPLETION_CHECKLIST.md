2. Implement Referral.create_referral_chain
3. Fix TaskAssignment workflow
4. Test models in Rails console

### Step 2: User Integration (Day 2-3)

2. Create dashboard view with XP/tasks
3. Implement task acceptance flow
4. Add admin review interface

### Step 4: Follow-up Integration (Day 4-5)

2. Create submission forms
3. Link to task assignments
4. Test submission workflow

### Step 5: Notifications & Jobs (Day 5-6)

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done for Phase 1

- [ ] Volunteer can see dashboard with XP/level
- [ ] Volunteer can accept tasks at their level
- [ ] Volunteer can submit task via follow-up
- [ ] Admin can review and approve/reject tasks
- [ ] XP awards and level-ups work correctly
- [ ] 5-level referral chains create properly
- [ ] Referral code sharing works
- [ ] Notifications trigger appropriately
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Seed data demonstrates features

## üî• Critical Success Factors

1. **Follow-up Integration**: Must leverage Decidim's existing system
2. **Referral Chain**: 5-level creation without loops
3. **XP System**: Automatic level-ups with notifications
4. **Task Workflow**: Complete accept ‚Üí submit ‚Üí review cycle
5. **Component Integration**: Proper Decidim component behavior

## üìù Notes

- Keep activity multiplier as stub (always 1.0) for Phase 1
- No token sale integration yet (Phase 2)
- No team features yet (Phase 2)
- Focus on core volunteer experience
- Use Decidim native features wherever possible

**Next Action**: Start with Step 1 - Fix Core Models, beginning with VolunteerProfile XP/level logic.
