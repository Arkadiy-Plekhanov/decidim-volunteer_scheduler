Breaking a monthly Scicent budget into weekly “pots,” then further into daily micro-rewards is a proven way to sustain momentum—but it also adds complexity. Here’s a quick pros/cons and a recommended approach:

### 🔹 Pros of Daily Distribution

1. **Consistent Engagement**
   Volunteers log in every day “to claim” their share, driving habitual platform use.
2. **Immediate Feedback**
   Daily rewards let volunteers see constant progress—very motivating in gamification studies.
3. **Fine-Grained Control**
   You can dial up or down daily amounts to respond to campaign needs (e.g. surge tasks).

### 🔸 Cons of Daily Distribution

1. **Operational Overhead**
   More frequent calculations, scheduled jobs, and UI elements to manage daily budgets.
2. **Diluted Impact**
   Tiny daily amounts may feel insignificant—volunteers might ignore micro-payments.
3. **Complex Rules Management**
   Splitting budget into 4 weekly buckets, then 7 daily slices, can be confusing for admins.

## ⚙️ Recommended Hybrid Model

1. **Monthly Core Budget**
   Admin sets a single monthly token budget (e.g. 10,000 Scicent).

2. **Weekly “Boost Weeks”**
   Split that budget into 4 weekly blocks (2,500 each). Released every Monday.

   * Volunteers see “This week’s pool: 2,500 tokens.”
   * Encourages planning for the week, not just a single day.

3. **Daily Engagement Bonuses**
   Within each week:

   * **Core daily share** = Weekly pool ÷ 7 (≈357 tokens).
   * **Bonus daily pot** = 10% of weekly pool (250 tokens) reserved for “top performers of the day.”
   * Top 5 volunteers by daily multiplier get a share of that bonus pot.

4. **Periodic Reviews & Roll-Over**

   * Unclaimed core daily tokens roll into next day’s pool.
   * Unclaimed weekly bonus tokens roll into next week’s bonus pot.

This hybrid gives you:

* A **steady floor** (core daily share) that volunteers expect.
* A **competitive ceiling** (bonus pot) that drives extra effort.
* **Manageable admin complexity** (splitting only twice instead of daily manual budgets).
