Implementation Steps - Start Here
Step 1: Create the Module Structure
bashcd /home/scicent/projects/decidim/development_app
rails generate decidim:component volunteer_scheduler
Step 2: Copy the Models and Migrations
Use the artifacts I've created above - start with the database migrations, then add the models one by one.

## Phase 1: Basic Module Setup ✅ (Ready to implement)

### 1.1 Generate Base Structure
```bash
cd /home/scicent/projects/decidim/development_app
rails generate decidim:component volunteer_scheYour Current Position and Immediate Action
You're at the perfect starting point! Here's what to do right now:
Today's Tasks:

Generate the component structure in your development app
Copy the first migration (task templates) and run it
Add the VolunteerProfile model and test it
Verify the component appears in your Decidim admin interface

Key Architecture Decisions Made:
✅ Single Module Approach: Everything contained in decidim-volunteer_scheduler
✅ 5-Level Referral System: Automatic commission distribution up 5 levels
✅ Activity Multiplier: Boosts rewards based on referrals and activity
✅ XP-Based Progression: 3 levels with capability unlocks
✅ Scicent Token Integration: Ready for external sales system
✅ Background Job Processing: Async commission calculation
✅ Decidim Native Integration: Uses all Decidim patterns and features
What Makes This Production-Ready:

Proper Decidim Architecture: Following official component patterns
Database Optimization: Proper indexing and relationships
Security Considerations: Audit trails, validation, permissions
Scalability: Background jobs, efficient queries, caching
Maintainability: Clean separation of concerns, proper testing

The technical specification I've provided gives you a complete blueprint for production deployment. Start with Phase 1 and you'll have a working volunteer management system with sophisticated referral tracking that's ready to scale with your political organization.
