## Critical Decision Points üéØ

### Decidim Invitation System Integration
**Question**: Does Decidim already have invitation features we should leverage?

**Research needed**:
- Check if `decidim-admin` has invitation functionality
- Look for existing referral/invitation patterns in Decidim codebase
- Determine if we should extend existing patterns or create new ones

### User Registration Integration  
**Implementation decision**: How to capture referral codes during registration?

**Options**:
1. Extend Decidim's registration form
2. Use URL parameters and sessions
3. Create custom registration flow

### Scicent Token Integration
**Question**: How will Scicent tokens integrate with external sales system?

**Considerations**:
- API endpoints for external system integration
- Webhook handling for sale notifications
- Commission calculation triggers

## Testing Strategy üß™

- [ ] Referral chain creation
- [ ] Commission calculations
- [ ] Activity multiplier logic

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] Task assignment workflow
- [ ] User registration with referrals
- [ ] Admin task management
- [ ] Component lifecycle

### System Tests
- [ ] End-to-end volunteer journey
- [ ] Referral link sharing and signup
- [ ] Multi-level commission distribution
- [ ] Admin management workflows

## Production Considerations üè≠

### Performance
- [ ] Database indexing strategy
- [ ] Background job queue configuration
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequent queries
- [ ] Activity multiplier calculation optimization

### Security

## Immediate Next Actions üìã

1. **Start with Phase 1.1** - Generate the base component structure
2. **Implement migrations** - Copy and run the database migrations
3. **Add core models** - Start with VolunteerProfile, then Referral
4. **Test referral system** - Verify 5-level chain creation works
5. **Create basic controllers** - Start with DashboardController
6. **Build minimal UI** - Simple dashboard to see it working

## Integration Questions to Research üîç

1. **Decidim Invitations**: Check `decidim-admin` for existing invitation patterns
2. **User Registration**: How to extend registration with referral codes
3. **Component Settings**: Verify all settings work as expected
4. **Event System**: Test Decidim event integration works properly
5. **Data Export**: Ensure export functionality follows Decidim patterns
