Below is a **best-practice proposal** for each facet of your referral + activity-multiplier system, based on modern gamification and loyalty programs. You can tweak any numbers later, but this gives you a solid, industry-standard starting point.

---

## A. Activity Multiplier Design

1. **Measurement Window**
   ➔ **Rolling 30-day window**

   * Captures both recent and sustained engagement.
   * Smooths out short bursts vs. long-term inactivity.

2. **Decay Mechanism**
   ➔ **Exponential decay of 25% every 7 days of no activity**

   * Prevents “multiplier inflation.”
   * Encourages continuous participation without punishing occasional absences.

3. **Action Weighting**
   ➔ **Weighted by action impact**

   * **Task completion**: weight = 1
   * **High-difficulty tasks**: weight = 2
   * **Token sales volume**: 1 point per \$10 of sales
   * **Referral-driven activity**: referral bonus multiplies weight by 0.5

4. **Multiplier Scale & Caps**

   * **Base**: 1.0
   * **Max cap**: 3.0
   * **Granularity**: 0.01
   * Rationale: cap prevents runaway advantage; fine granularity keeps competition meaningful.

5. **Referral Influence on Multiplier**
   ➔ **Diminishing returns per level**

   * **Level 1**: 20% of each referred volunteer’s multiplier
   * **Level 2**: 10%
   * **Level 3**: 5%
   * **Levels 4–5**: 2% each
   * Rationale: rewards direct referrals more strongly while still valuing deeper network effects.

## B. Budget Allocation

6. **Distribution Frequency**
   ➔ **Monthly on calendar month**

   * Aligns with finance and reporting cycles.
   * Easier for volunteers to track “Your monthly reward.”

7. **Budget Size**
   ➔ **Variable % of profits** (set each month)

   * Ties volunteer rewards to actual organizational performance.
   * Encourages mutual success.

8. **Leftover Handling**
   ➔ **Roll into next period**

   * Prevents loss of volunteer incentive.
   * Builds “carry-over” buffer in leaner months.

## C. Referral Commission on Sales

9. **Commission Rates per Level**

   * **Level 1**: 10%
   * **Level 2**: 5%
   * **Level 3**: 3%
   * **Level 4**: 2%
   * **Level 5**: 1%
   * Rationale: competitive direct reward with long-tail network incentives.

10. **Trigger for Commission**
    ➔ **Auto-credit immediately on sale record**

    * Fast feedback loop boosts satisfaction.
    * Admin audit/reversal capability handles disputes (see next).

11. **Reversal/Audit**
    ➔ **Yes** — allow admins to reverse or adjust individual commissions

    * Ensures governance and fraud prevention.

## D. Multiplier & Commission Interaction

12. **Separate Pools vs. Combined**
    ➔ **Separate but synergistic**

    * Keep **activity multiplier** based purely on actions.
    * Keep **commission earnings** as a separate ledger.
    * **Optional bonus**: treat large commission events (e.g. > \$1,000) as a one-time activity boost of +0.1 to multiplier, capped once per period.

13. **Transparency**
    ➔ **Full breakdown** in volunteer dashboard:

    * **Own activity**: your raw multiplier vs. **referral contributions** per level
    * **Referral tree visualization**: show up to 3 levels with contributions
    * **Detailed transaction log**: XP, sales, commissions, and bonus events

### Why these choices?

* **Rolling windows + decay** are common in loyalty programs to keep users engaged without penalizing short absences.
* **Weighted actions** ensure volunteers are rewarded proportionally to effort/value.
* **Caps + granularity** balance fairness and competitiveness.
* **Diminishing referral returns** prevent top-heavy networks and encourage depth.
* **Monthly distribution** aligns with reporting, while **rolling leftovers** maintain trust.
* **Immediate commissions** maximize motivation; **audit tools** safeguard integrity.
* **Separate pools** keep accounting clear, with optional synergy to reward big drivers.
* **Transparency** builds trust and drives healthy competition.

Feel free to adjust any percentage, window, or cap—this framework gives you a robust, best-practice foundation.
