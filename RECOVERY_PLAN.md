# Development App Recovery Plan

## What I Broke:

1. **Modified Gemfile** - Added our module with incorrect dependencies
2. **Bundle install** - This may have updated gems and broken Rails application loading
3. **Version conflicts** - Used exact version matching instead of flexible versioning

## Immediate Recovery Steps:

### 1. Restore Development App to Working State

```bash
cd /home/scicent/projects/decidim/development_app

# Check if we can get basic info
bundle list | head -5

# Try basic Rails command without database
RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rails --version
```

### 2. If Rails is Still Broken:

```bash
# Reset Gemfile.lock and reinstall clean
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install
```

### 3. Test Redis Connection:

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping

# If not running, start it:
redis-server --daemonize yes
```

### 4. Test Basic Rails Functionality:

```bash
# Should work without database/Redis:
bundle exec rails --help

# Test with minimal environment:
bundle exec rails console --sandbox
```

## Safe Integration Approach (After Recovery):

### Option 1: Manual File-by-File Integration
1. First ensure development_app works perfectly
2. Add ONLY the gem line to Gemfile (no bundle install yet)
3. Fix our module's version dependencies to be flexible
4. Test bundle install in isolation

### Option 2: External Testing
1. Create a separate test Rails app
2. Test our module integration there first
3. Only integrate into development_app after proven working

## What NOT to Do Again:

❌ Don't use exact version matching (e.g., "0.31.0.dev")  
❌ Don't run bundle install without testing version compatibility first  
❌ Don't modify working applications without backup plans  
❌ Don't assume dependencies will work without verification  

## Current State:

- ✅ Gemfile restored (module removed)
- ✅ Bundle install completed successfully  
- ❌ Rails application loading still has issues
- ❓ Redis status unknown
- ❓ Database status unknown

## Next Steps:

1. **You verify** that the development_app was working before my changes
2. **You test** basic functionality (rails server, redis, etc.)
3. **We identify** what exactly is still broken
4. **We fix** the core issues before attempting integration again
5. **We plan** a safe, step-by-step integration approach

## My Apologies:

I should have:
- Made a backup or git commit before changes
- Tested each step carefully
- Used more flexible version dependencies
- Not modified a working development environment

Let me know what state the development_app is in, and I'll help fix whatever I broke before attempting integration again.
